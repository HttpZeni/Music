# Music Player

A custom-built, pixel-perfect audio player with full drag. 

## ✨ What it does

- 🎵 Plays `.mp3` files in-browser (yes, including your weird anime remixes)
- 🖱️ Drag & Drop GUI (player + upload window)
- 🧠 Dynamic playlist with custom names
- 🔊 Volume control, playback control, progress bar
- 🎮 Keyboard controls (because clicking is for mortals)
- 🕶️ Gengar GIFs and dark theme vibes
- 📂 Upload your own songs (local files, nothing gets sent anywhere)

## 🚀 How to use it

1. Open [this](https://httpzeni.github.io/Music/) in your browser.
2. Click the upload window, pick a `.mp3`, give it a name, and hit submit.
3. Your song appears in the list – click to play.
4. Control playback with buttons or keyboard.
5. Drag the windows around just because you can.
